    <strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio surged +7.08% this week</strong>, lifting total returns since inception (October 9, 2025) to +3.86% while maintaining all 10 positions. Over the same Nov 20 – Nov 28 window, the S&P 500 advanced +2.57% and Bitcoin rose +4.36%, though both benchmarks still trail the portfolio on a cumulative basis.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Portfolio Progress Nov 20 – Nov 28, 2025</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio is a $10,000 high-conviction momentum strategy</strong> managed by a transformer-based AI model, built to outperform the S&P 500 by concentrating capital into 6–10 stocks with strong multi-week momentum and catalysts. The portfolio began with 10 equal-weight positions and now dynamically adapts as opportunities evolve.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week’s strong rebound reflects broad strength across semiconductors, gold miners, and select industrials</strong>, reversing last week’s pullback and reaffirming the strategy’s ability to compound gains during momentum-driven upcycles.

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio currently holds 10 positions</strong>, with no trades executed this week and position weights ranging from ~8% to ~13%:

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Top Movers: Semiconductor Momentum and Materials Strength</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Semiconductors led the surge, with WDC and STX gaining +12–13% this week</strong>. Strong storage-demand forecasts and continued AI-driven hardware cycles pushed both stocks sharply higher, reinforcing their role as the portfolio’s primary momentum engine.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Newmont Corp (NEM) jumped +10.4%</strong> as gold rallied on falling real yields and rising geopolitical uncertainty. This boost helped stabilize the portfolio’s Materials exposure and provided a useful non-tech counterbalance.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Palantir rose +6.56%</strong> in a continuation of its multi-week recovery, helping ease prior drawdowns from earlier November softness. While still below peak value, the trend remains constructive.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Royal Caribbean (RCL) gained +5.1%</strong>, finally showing signs of a rebound after several choppy weeks tied to travel demand moderation. Its weight remains manageable at ~8%, avoiding concentration risk even during periods of volatility.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>All positions remain well within risk limits</strong>, with no stock exceeding the 20% cap or falling below the $500 minimum size.</li>
    <li><strong>No drawdown triggers activated</strong>: none of the holdings are down more than 25% from their portfolio peak values.</li>
    <li><strong>The portfolio outperforms the S&P 500 by roughly +200 bps</strong> since inception, avoiding any benchmark underperformance triggers.</li>
    <li><strong>Only one week of negative performance occurred in the past three weeks</strong>, so no momentum-break conditions apply.</li>
    <li><strong>Current sector exposure remains balanced</strong>, with Technology around one-third of the portfolio—comfortably below the 45% sector cap.</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum across the portfolio is improving</strong>, reducing the need to rotate into new candidates prematurely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Market Opportunities Under Review</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    While the portfolio warrants a HOLD this week, the market scan identified several strong momentum candidates worth monitoring for future rotations or upgrades:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)</strong> – Upward earnings revisions and a strong momentum score make it an attractive Materials diversifier should gold strength continue.</li>
    <li><strong>NVIDIA (NVDA)</strong> – +7% four-week momentum and industry-leading AI fundamentals keep it a top-tier candidate for potential semiconductor rotation.</li>
    <li><strong>Lam Research (LRCX)</strong> – High 12-month momentum and semi equipment leadership provide exposure to a deeper AI-capex cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)</strong> – Strong long-term momentum and gold miner resilience make it compelling within Materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Argan Inc. (AGX)</strong> – Strong industrial momentum and underweight cyclical exposure make AGX worth monitoring for future diversification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    These candidates remain on the watchlist but do not justify immediate action while the current portfolio meets all performance and risk criteria.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Verdict</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week clearly supports a disciplined HOLD</strong>. The portfolio is outperforming major benchmarks, all positions remain healthy, and sector exposure stays within target bands. Momentum conditions have strengthened across semiconductors and materials, reinforcing conviction in the current allocation.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Unless a position breaches the 20% limit, falls below $500, or experiences a -25% drawdown from peak, the strategy will remain focused on stability and letting winners compound.
