❌ **Prompt A Validation: FAIL**

Found **1** clear calculation error in **Week 8** (more may exist, but the first is already outside tolerance):

1. PLTR weekly_pct: expected **6.43%**, got **6.56%**

Reason:
Previous price = 155.75
Current price = 165.77
((165.77 − 155.75) / 155.75) × 100 = **6.43%**
Difference vs stored value = **0.13%**, which exceeds the allowed ±0.01 tolerance.

Because one material error is already present, Week 8 validation **fails**.
