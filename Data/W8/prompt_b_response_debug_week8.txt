The full Prompt B deliverables cannot be generated because the message is **missing required inputs**:

- `performance_table.html` (automation‑generated)
- `performance_chart.svg` (automation‑generated)

Your instructions say these *are provided in the user message*, but they are not present anywhere in the content.

Because Prompt B must include required placeholder comments **in the correct section locations**, but cannot fabricate or assume content that wasn’t supplied, this run cannot proceed.

### What I need from you
Please resend your Week 8 request and include the following two files directly in your message:

1. **performance_table.html**
2. **performance_chart.svg**

Once those are included, I will immediately generate:

- `narrative.html` (full structured HTML block with placeholders)
- `seo.json` (complete metadata object with JSON‑LD)
- `decision_summary.json`

Just resend with the two missing files and I'll complete the output.
