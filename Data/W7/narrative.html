  <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-6">This week, the GenAi Chosen portfolio surged 7.08%, reversing last week’s drawdown and lifting total return to 3.86% since inception, while the S&P 500 gained 2.57% on the week and Bitcoin rose 4.23% but remains down sharply at -25.95% since launch.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Portfolio Progress 2025-11-20 – 2025-11-28, 2025</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio continues its experiment in AI-driven, high-momentum equity selection</strong>. Built on a transformer-based ranking model, the system allocates $10,000 across ten stocks chosen for asymmetric upside, trend persistence, and sector diversification. Now seven weeks in, the framework’s goal remains unchanged: steadily outperform the S&P 500 while embracing the volatility that accompanies a high-conviction strategy.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>This week marked a strong rebound</strong> as the portfolio clawed back the prior week’s losses with a broad-based rally in semiconductors, gold miners, travel, and healthcare. Performance was driven by a synchronized uplift across high-beta names, showing the model’s preference for momentum-heavy assets can deliver meaningful upside when macro conditions align.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>The model’s resilience shows in this week’s turnaround</strong>, with several positions recovering decisively above their cost basis. With total performance now ahead of the S&P 500 and far above Bitcoin’s drawdown, the GenAi Chosen portfolio continues to validate its rules-driven, AI-directed approach.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The portfolio currently holds the following positions, representing the full 10-stock allocation:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li>PLTR – Palantir Technologies</li>
    <li>NEM – Newmont Corp</li>
    <li>STX – Seagate Technology</li>
    <li>GEV – GE Vernova</li>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>No trades were executed this week</strong>, meaning the rebound reflects pure market-driven appreciation. All positions remain active, and performance changes are solely the result of price movement.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Top Movers: Semiconductors Lead, Gold Strengthens, Travel Stabilizes</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Semiconductors delivered the strongest lift</strong>, with STX jumping 13.21% and WDC climbing 12.49% on renewed optimism around AI-driven storage demand. These gains continue a multi-week trend of leadership from the data infrastructure segment, propelling both holdings to the top of the portfolio’s total-return stack.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Gold miners also rebounded meaningfully</strong>, with NEM rising 10.38% as gold prices rallied on softer Treasury yields. This week’s strength pushed Newmont firmly into positive territory since inception, reinforcing gold’s role as a volatility hedge within an otherwise growth-tilted portfolio.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Travel stocks showed stability and improvement</strong>, with RCL gaining 5.15% despite still being the largest laggard in total return at -13.45%. While the drawdown remains significant, this week’s recovery suggests selling pressure may be stabilizing as holiday demand expectations firm up.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Industrial and energy names offered steady, supportive gains</strong>, including GEV at +5.69%, CVS at +5.01%, and NRG at +4.97%. These moderate advances helped smooth volatility across sectors and contributed to the portfolio’s balanced recovery.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Palantir also participated in the upside</strong>, gaining 6.43% on the week, though it remains down -10.62% overall. Its high-volatility profile continues to make it a swing contributor week-to-week, but momentum turned definitively positive during this period.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Performance Snapshot</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The table below compares the GenAi Chosen portfolio to the S&P 500 and Bitcoin across key checkpoints. The portfolio remains ahead of both benchmarks on a total-return basis.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Performance Since Inception</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The chart below shows normalized performance for the portfolio, the S&P 500, and Bitcoin, allowing apples-to-apples comparison regardless of starting price levels.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">All assets are normalized to 100 on the October 9, 2025 inception date, with 100 displayed as the central reference line. Readings above 100 indicate gains since inception; readings below 100 indicate losses.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The GenAi Chosen portfolio now sits meaningfully above the 100 baseline, outperforming both the S&P 500, which is only modestly above 100, and Bitcoin, which remains sharply below the line. This divergence reflects the portfolio’s strong recovery momentum and the AI model’s capacity to capture targeted upside.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Strong weekly rebound with broad participation</strong> supports maintaining current exposures, as the portfolio reclaimed momentum across semis, gold, and industrials.</li>
    <li><strong>Total return now positive at +3.86%</strong>, placing the strategy ahead of both benchmarks and meeting the model’s near-term performance expectations.</li>
    <li><strong>No holdings breached downside risk triggers</strong>, including the -20% loss threshold or concentration imbalance rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Benchmark behavior remains favorable</strong> with the S&P 500 rising steadily and volatility cooling, reducing the need for defensive repositioning.</li>
    <li><strong>Macro conditions improved</strong>, with easing yields and strengthening demand indicators aligning with the model’s momentum exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Rebalance is unnecessary</strong> at this stage because no holdings exceed position caps, and the model seeks continuity during strengthening uptrends.</li>
    <li><strong>HOLD preserves trend consistency</strong> while allowing the AI selection thesis to compound following a well-supported multi-sector rally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Verdict</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>The decision this week is a clear HOLD</strong> as the portfolio demonstrates strong recovery momentum, broad sector support, and total-return leadership over major benchmarks. The rules governing risk and position sizing show no violation, reinforcing stability in the model’s allocations.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>A shift toward REBALANCE or SELL</strong> would require either renewed multi-position drawdowns or significant macro deterioration. For now, the portfolio is aligned with its intended growth posture and performing according to expectations.</p>
